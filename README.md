## 1. How can understanding your audienceâ€™s expertise level (tech experts vs. regular folks) shape the way you present technical information?

    This is because it will help in forming the speech of your presentation in that you will know which terms & terminologies to use when presenting e.g you can use words such as deploying, debugging push/pull requests without having to explain too much about them to tech experts as opposed to you'd have to explain the meaning of these terms to regular folks.
    This may also help you to know the channels of communication to your audience e.g for tech experts, you may use GitHub as means of communication while for regular folks who may not know too much about GitHub, you would have to use a more common means of communication e.g Social media platforms as a means of communication.
